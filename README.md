# Topic_Modelling

This notebook is a gentle intro to LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and topic modelling.
the goal is to attribute each text corpus to a specific topic.
The dataset is from Quora website, it is intended to be so because Quora has a wide variety of unstructured data about divergent topics.
